# Maze Solver

## Brief Description
Our project is about tracing the shortest path from a input maze image and then applying the concepts of Digital Image Processing and Game Theory to obtain a final Output


## Setup and Installation
This project expects the following libraries to be present on the users system along with Python3 version 3.8.10

These libraries can be installed via pip3

OpenCV: a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision
