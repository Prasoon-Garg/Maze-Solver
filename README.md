# Maze Solver

## Brief Description
Our project is about tracing the shortest path from a input maze image and then applying the concepts of Digital Image Processing and Game Theory to obtain a final Output


## Setup and Installation
This project expects the following libraries to be present on the users system along with Python3 version 3.8.10

These libraries can be installed via pip3

* > **_OpenCV:_** a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision <br>
* > **_Numpy:_** for dealing with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices <br>
* > **_MatplotLib:_** a plotting library

Version details are present in requirements.txt

## How to download and run the code
* Download and extract the zip file from github repo <br>
* Now open the src folder and run the maze_solver.py file
* To run for a custom input file, firstly paste the file in data/input/
* Now change the file name 


## Sample outputs
